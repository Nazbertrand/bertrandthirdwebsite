    <p>Anthony DeVante Edwards, widely known as “Ant-Man,” was born on August 5, 2001, in Atlanta, Georgia. He grew up with his mother, Chrisha, and grandmother, Shirley, who both passed away from cancer in 2015 while he was still in middle school. After their deaths, his older siblings, Antoine and Antoinette, became his legal guardians. Edwards first attended Therrell High School before transferring to Holy Spirit Preparatory School, where he helped win a Georgia state championship in 2018. A five-star recruit, he chose to play college basketball at the University of Georgia to stay close to family. During the 2019–20 season, he averaged about 19 points per game, won SEC Freshman of the Year, and built a reputation as a dynamic scorer despite occasional inconsistencies.

In 2020, Edwards declared for the NBA Draft and was selected first overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves. His rookie season was impressive, earning him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie First Team and second place in Rookie of the Year voting. Over the next few years, he steadily improved, becoming the face of the Timberwolves and one of the league’s brightest young stars. His explosive athleticism, scoring ability, and leadership on the court led to multiple NBA All-Star appearances and an All-NBA Second Team selection. In the 2023–24 season, he delivered breakout performances that helped Minnesota make a deep playoff run.

Beyond the NBA, Edwards has represented Team USA on the international stage. He competed in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, where he was named to the All-FIBA World Cup Team, and later helped lead the U.S. to a gold medal at the 2024 Olympics. Off the court, Edwards honors his late mother and grandmother by wearing jersey number 5, since both passed away on the 5th of a month. In March 2024, he welcomed his daughter, Aislynn, with his girlfriend Shannon. His journey, marked by personal tragedy and resilience, has shaped him into both a rising basketball superstar and an inspiring figure off the court.</p>
